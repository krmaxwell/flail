A Python library for being a CND Batman....

## Setup
You'll want to run ```script/bootstrap``` to install the necessary dependencies (under VirtualEnv) and to pull down the GeoLiteCity database from [Maxmind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home). In Linux (Ubuntu), you may need to install `libgeoip-dev`.

## Tests
Super simple. After you've run setup just use ```script/test``` to run the test suite.
